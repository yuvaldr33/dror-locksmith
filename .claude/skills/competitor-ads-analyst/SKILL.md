# Competitor Ads Analyst

Analyze competitor advertising from public ad libraries to understand what messaging, creative formats, and positioning strategies are working.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatrebeccarae/claude-marketing.git && cp -r claude-marketing/skills/competitor-ads-analyst ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Core Capabilities

- Extract ads from public ad libraries (Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- Categorize ad creative by format, message type, and funnel stage
- Identify pain points competitors highlight (with frequency scoring)
- Map competitor positioning and find white space
- Extract headline and copy formulas
- Track creative format trends (UGC, before/after, testimonial, etc.)
- Generate competitive intelligence reports and swipe files

## Ad Library Access

| Platform | URL | Access |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Meta (Facebook/Instagram) | facebook.com/ads/library | Free, public |
| Google Ads | adstransparency.google.com | Free, public |
| TikTok | library.tiktok.com | Free, public |
| LinkedIn | linkedin.com/ad-library | Requires account |

## Workflow

### 1. Define Scope

- **Competitors:** 3-5 companies to analyze
- **Timeframe:** Last 30, 60, or 90 days
- **Platforms:** Which ad libraries to search
- **Focus:** Messaging, creative format, audience targeting, or all

### 2. Extract Ads

For each competitor, collect:
- Ad copy (headline, primary text, CTA)
- Creative format (image, video, carousel, UGC)
- Landing page URL
- Active date range (if visible)
- Platform and placement

### 3. Categorize

Classify each ad by:

**Message Type:**
- Pain point (problem-aware)
- Solution (product-aware)
- Social proof (testimonial, case study, press)
- Offer (discount, free trial, demo)
- Educational (how-to, tip, guide)
- Brand (awareness, positioning)

**Funnel Stage:**
- Top (awareness, problem education)
- Middle (consideration, comparison)
- Bottom (conversion, offer, urgency)

**Creative Format:**
- Static image
- Video (short <15s, medium 15-60s, long >60s)
- Carousel
- UGC-style
- Before/after
- Screenshot/product demo
- Testimonial quote card
- Data/stat visualization

### 4. Analyze Patterns

- **Pain point frequency:** Which problems appear most across competitors?
- **Message clustering:** Are competitors saying the same things?
- **Format preferences:** Which creative types are most used?
- **Positioning map:** Where does each competitor sit on key dimensions?
- **Gaps:** What messages/angles are NO competitors using?

### 5. Generate Output

Choose from: competitive report, swipe file, messaging matrix, or creative brief.

## Key Principles

1. **Analyze patterns, not individual ads.** One ad is an anecdote; 20 ads from 5 competitors is intelligence.
2. **Look for gaps, not just patterns.** The most valuable finding is what competitors are NOT saying.
3. **Separate observation from recommendation.** Report what you see, then separately recommend what to do with it.
4. **Date everything.** Competitive intelligence decays fast.
5. **Never copy, always adapt.** The goal is informed inspiration, not plagiarism.
