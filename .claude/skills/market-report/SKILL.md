# Marketing Report Generator (Markdown Format)

## Skill Purpose
Generate a comprehensive, professionally formatted marketing report in Markdown. This skill compiles data from all previous audit and analysis results into a single, client-ready document with scores, findings, recommendations, and a prioritized action plan with revenue impact estimates.

## When to Use
- User wants a full marketing report for a client or their own business
- User has completed one or more audit skills and wants a compiled report
- User asks for a marketing assessment, scorecard, or analysis document
- Triggered by `/market report` or `/market report <domain>`

## How to Execute

### Step 1: Collect All Available Data
Before generating the report, check for any existing audit data from previous skill runs. Look for these files in the project directory:

**Possible data sources:**
- `MARKETING-AUDIT.md` -- from `/market audit`
- `LANDING-CRO.md` -- from `/market landing`
- `SEO-AUDIT.md` -- from `/market seo`
- `BRAND-VOICE.md` -- from `/market brand`
- `COMPETITOR-ANALYSIS.md` -- from `/market competitors`
- `FUNNEL-ANALYSIS.md` -- from `/market funnel`
- `CONTENT-AUDIT.md` -- from content analysis
- `AD-AUDIT.md` -- from `/market ads`
- `SOCIAL-AUDIT.md` -- from `/market social`
- `EMAIL-AUDIT.md` -- from `/market emails`

If no previous data exists, inform the user and offer to:
1. Run a quick audit first (recommended)
2. Generate a report based on available information (website URL, user-provided data)
3. Create a report template they can fill in

### Step 2: Calculate the Marketing Scorecard

### Step 3: Write Category Deep-Dives

For each of the 6 categories, provide:

1. **Score and Rating** -- X/100 with interpretation
2. **Key Findings** -- 3-5 specific observations with evidence
3. **What's Working** -- Positive elements to preserve and build on
4. **Gaps and Issues** -- Problems identified with severity ratings
5. **Recommendations** -- Specific, actionable improvements ranked by impact
6. **Revenue Impact Estimate** -- Estimated financial impact of implementing recommendations

**Revenue Impact Estimation Framework:**
```
Impact = (Estimated traffic change * Conversion rate change * Average deal value) * Confidence factor

Example:
- Current monthly traffic: 10,000
- Recommended SEO improvements could increase traffic 30%: +3,000 visits
- Current conversion rate: 2%, CRO could improve to 3%: +1% = +130 conversions
- Average deal value: $500
- Estimated monthly revenue impact: $65,000
- Confidence factor (conservative): 0.5
- Conservative estimate: $32,500/month additional revenue
```

### Step 4: Competitor Comparison Summary
If competitor data is available from `/market competitors`, include:

**Competitive Positioning Matrix:**
| Factor | Client | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Website Quality | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 |
| SEO Visibility | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 |
| Content Quality | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 |
| Social Presence | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 | X/10 |
| Overall Position | Xth/4 | Xth/4 | Xth/4 | Xth/4 |

**Competitive Advantages:** What the client does better
**Competitive Gaps:** Where competitors outperform the client
**Opportunities:** Spaces competitors are not addressing

### Step 5: Content Quality Assessment
Summarize content findings across all channels:

- **Website copy** -- Clarity, persuasiveness, brand alignment
- **Blog content** -- Depth, expertise, SEO optimization, publishing cadence
- **Social media content** -- Engagement quality, brand consistency, platform optimization
- **Email content** -- Subject line effectiveness, body copy quality, CTA strength
- **Ad creative** -- Messaging clarity, visual quality, offer presentation

### Step 6: Conversion Optimization Summary
Compile all conversion-related findings:

- **Primary conversion paths** -- How visitors become customers
- **Funnel leaks** -- Where potential customers drop off
- **CRO quick wins** -- Changes that can be implemented immediately
- **Testing opportunities** -- A/B tests recommended with hypotheses
- **Benchmark comparison** -- Current rates vs industry standards

### Step 7: SEO Snapshot
Summarize SEO health in a scannable format:

```
SEO Health Snapshot:
- Title Tags: [Optimized / Needs Work / Missing]
- Meta Descriptions: [Optimized / Needs Work / Missing]
- H1 Tags: [Proper / Issues / Missing]
- Image Alt Text: [Complete / Partial / Missing]
- Page Speed: [Fast / Moderate / Slow]
- Mobile-Friendly: [Yes / Partially / No]
- Schema Markup: [Present / Partial / Missing]
- Robots.txt: [Configured / Issues / Missing]
- Sitemap: [Present / Issues / Missing]
- HTTPS: [Yes / No]
- Core Web Vitals: [Pass / Needs Work / Fail]
```

### Step 8: Build the Prioritized Action Plan

Organize all recommendations into three tiers:

#### Quick Wins (Implement This Week)
High impact, low effort changes. These should be implementable within 1-5 business days.

Format each item as:
```
- [ ] [Action item]: [Specific description]
  - Impact: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
  - Effort: [1-5 hours]
  - Expected Result: [Specific outcome]
  - Revenue Impact: [$X/month estimated]
```

#### Medium-Term (Implement This Month)
Moderate impact, moderate effort. These require 1-4 weeks.

#### Strategic (Implement This Quarter)
High impact, high effort. These are foundational changes that require planning and sustained effort.

### Step 9: Build the 30-60-90 Day Roadmap

**Days 1-30: Foundation & Quick Wins**
- Week 1: Implement all quick wins from the action plan
- Week 2: Set up tracking and analytics baseline
- Week 3: Begin medium-term improvements
- Week 4: First performance review and adjustment

**Days 31-60: Growth & Optimization**
- Week 5-6: Launch core campaign improvements
- Week 7: A/B testing program begins
- Week 8: Content strategy implementation

**Days 61-90: Scale & Expand**
- Week 9-10: Scale what's working, cut what isn't
- Week 11: Expand to new channels or campaigns
- Week 12: Comprehensive review, update strategy for next quarter

### Step 10: Appendix

Include methodology notes so the client understands how scores were derived:

**Scoring Methodology:**
- How each category was evaluated
- Data sources used
- Benchmarks referenced
- Limitations and assumptions
- Date of analysis

**Tools Used:**
- List any tools or scripts used in the analysis
- Reference to scripts/analyze_page.py if used

**Glossary:**
- Define marketing terms that a non-marketer client may not know
- Keep it relevant to terms used in the report

## Key Principles
- This report should be impressive enough to use as a sales tool. A well-crafted marketing report can open the door to a client engagement.
- Always lead with insights and opportunities, not criticism. Frame everything through the lens of growth potential.
- Quantify everything possible. "$32,000/month in unrealized revenue" is more compelling than "you're leaving money on the table."
- Make the action plan so specific that someone could hand it to a junior marketer and they could execute it.
- Use professional formatting: consistent headers, tables for data, checkboxes for action items, clear visual hierarchy.
- If data from previous skills is available, reference specific findings. If not, be transparent about what's based on analysis vs estimation.
- The report should tell a story: Here's where you are, here's where you could be, here's how to get there, and here's what it's worth.
