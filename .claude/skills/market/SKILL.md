## Routing Logic

When the user invokes `/market <command>`, route to the appropriate sub-skill:

### Full Marketing Audit (`/market audit <url>`)
This is the flagship command. It launches **5 parallel subagents** to analyze the website simultaneously:

1. **market-content** agent → Content quality, messaging, copy effectiveness
2. **market-conversion** agent → CRO, funnels, landing pages, signup flows
3. **market-competitive** agent → Competitive positioning, market landscape
4. **market-technical** agent → Technical SEO, site architecture, page speed
5. **market-strategy** agent → Overall strategy, pricing, growth opportunities

**Scoring Methodology (Marketing Score 0-100):**
| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Content & Messaging | 25% | Copy quality, value props, clarity, persuasion |
| Conversion Optimization | 20% | CTAs, forms, friction, social proof, urgency |
| SEO & Discoverability | 20% | On-page SEO, technical SEO, content structure |
| Competitive Positioning | 15% | Differentiation, market awareness, alternatives pages |
| Brand & Trust | 10% | Brand consistency, trust signals, social proof |
| Growth & Strategy | 10% | Pricing, referral, retention, expansion opportunities |

**Composite Marketing Score** = Weighted average of all 6 categories

### Quick Snapshot (`/market quick <url>`)
Fast 60-second assessment. Do NOT launch subagents. Instead:
1. Fetch the homepage using WebFetch
2. Evaluate: headline clarity, CTA strength, value proposition, trust signals, mobile readiness
3. Output a quick scorecard with top 3 wins and top 3 fixes
4. Keep output under 30 lines

### Individual Commands
For all other commands (`/market copy`, `/market emails`, etc.), route to the corresponding sub-skill in `skills/market-<command>/SKILL.md`.

## Business Context Detection

Before running any analysis, detect the business type:
- **SaaS/Software** → Focus on: trial-to-paid conversion, onboarding, feature pages, pricing tiers
- **E-commerce** → Focus on: product pages, cart abandonment, upsells, reviews
- **Agency/Services** → Focus on: case studies, portfolio, contact forms, trust signals
- **Local Business** → Focus on: Google Business Profile, local SEO, reviews, directions
- **Creator/Course** → Focus on: lead magnets, email capture, testimonials, community
- **Marketplace** → Focus on: two-sided messaging, supply/demand balance, trust mechanisms

## Output Standards

All outputs must follow these rules:
1. **Actionable over theoretical** — Every recommendation must be specific enough to implement
2. **Prioritized** — Always rank by impact (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Revenue-focused** — Connect every suggestion to business outcomes
4. **Example-driven** — Include before/after copy examples, not just advice
5. **Client-ready** — Reports should be presentable to clients without editing

## File Output

Save detailed outputs to markdown files in the current directory:
- Use descriptive filenames: `MARKETING-AUDIT.md`, `COMPETITOR-REPORT.md`, etc.
- Include the URL, date, and overall score at the top
- Structure with clear headers and tables
- Include an executive summary for client-facing reports

## Cross-Skill References

Many skills work together:
- `/market audit` calls all subagents → produces comprehensive analysis
- `/market proposal` can reference audit results if available
- `/market report` and `/market report-pdf` compile all available analysis data
- `/market copy` benefits from `/market brand` voice guidelines if run first
- `/market emails` uses insights from `/market funnel` analysis if available
