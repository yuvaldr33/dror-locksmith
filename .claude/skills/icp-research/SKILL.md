# ICP Research

Build comprehensive ideal customer profiles for targeted marketing, including community discovery and voice-of-customer language extraction.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatrebeccarae/claude-marketing.git && cp -r claude-marketing/skills/icp-research ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Product Context

- What do you sell?
- Key features and differentiators
- Pricing model and range
- Current customers (who buys today?)

### 2. Define Market

- Industry / vertical
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Geography
- B2B vs. B2C vs. B2B2C

### 3. Build Persona

**Demographics:**
- Job title and seniority level
- Department and reporting structure
- Company size and revenue range
- Industry and sub-vertical
- Geography and timezone

**Psychographics:**
- Daily responsibilities (what fills their calendar)
- Goals they are measured on (KPIs, OKRs)
- Frustrations and daily friction
- Career aspirations
- How they stay informed (publications, podcasts, communities)

**Buying Behavior:**
- Who influences the decision?
- Who approves the budget?
- What is the buying process? (self-serve, demo, RFP, committee)
- Evaluation criteria (price, features, support, integration)
- Typical buying timeline

### 4. Map Pain Points

| Category | Questions to Answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Time** | What takes too long? What manual work do they hate? |
| **Money** | Where are they wasting budget? What costs too much? |
| **Risk** | What keeps them up at night? What could go wrong? |
| **Quality** | Where is output inconsistent or error-prone? |
| **Growth** | What blocks them from scaling? |

Score each pain point: **Frequency** (1-10) x **Intensity** (1-10) = **Priority Score**

### 5. Identify Objections

| Objection Type | Response Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Price** | ROI calculation, cost of inaction, payment flexibility |
| **Time** | Quick setup, done-for-you options, time-to-value metrics |
| **Trust** | Social proof, case studies, free trial/pilot, guarantees |
| **Need** | Cost of status quo, competitor pressure, market trends |
| **Authority** | Executive summary, ROI one-pager, pilot proposal |

### 6. Map Buying Triggers

**External triggers:**
- New funding round or budget cycle
- Leadership change (new CMO, VP)
- Competitor pressure (lost deal, feature gap)
- Regulatory change (compliance deadline)
- Failed vendor or tool (contract end, outage)

**Internal triggers:**
- Missed targets (revenue, growth, efficiency)
- Team complaints (process pain, tool frustration)
- Process breaking at scale
- New initiative requiring new capabilities
- Budget cuts forcing consolidation

### 7. Community Research

Discover where your ICP gathers online and extract their exact language.

**Platforms to search:**
- Reddit (subreddits by industry/role)
- Facebook Groups
- Discord and Slack communities
- LinkedIn Groups
- Quora and Stack Exchange
- Industry forums
- YouTube comments
- App review sites (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)

**Search templates:**
```
"[industry/role] frustrating OR annoying"
"why is [process] so hard"
"alternatives to [competitor]"
"[tool] vs [tool]"
"best [tool type] for [use case]"
"I switched from [tool] because"
```

**What to extract:**
- Exact phrases and vocabulary they use (voice-of-customer)
- Pain points with emotional language
- Evaluation criteria they mention
- Competitors they compare
- Objections they raise

**Classify community members:**
- **Actively seeking:** ready to buy, asking for recommendations
- **Aware but stuck:** know the problem, not acting on it
- **Venting only:** complaining but unlikely to change

### 8. Craft Messaging Angles

For each pain point, create:
- **Headline:** attention-grabbing statement
- **Supporting proof:** data point, case study, or testimonial
- **CTA:** specific next step

## Output Format

See REFERENCE.md for the complete ICP profile template.

## Key Principles

1. **Real language over marketing language.** Use the exact words your ICP uses, not polished marketing copy.
2. **Pain over features.** Lead with what hurts, not what you built.
3. **Specificity wins.** "VP of Marketing at a 50-person SaaS company" > "Marketing leaders."
4. **Validate with data.** Community research > assumptions.
5. **One ICP per profile.** If you serve different personas, create separate profiles.

For templates and frameworks, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).
