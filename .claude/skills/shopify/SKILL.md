## Workflow: Full Shopify Audit

When asked to audit a Shopify store's marketing:

2. **Conversion Funnel** — Session → ATC → Checkout → Purchase rates, identify largest drop-off
3. **Site Speed** — Core Web Vitals, theme performance, app bloat, image optimization
4. **Product Pages** — Layout, imagery, copy, reviews, trust signals, urgency elements
5. **Collection Pages** — Navigation, filters, sorting, merchandising rules

8. **Paid Media Integration** — Pixel health, CAPI event match quality, product feed quality
9. **SEO** — Title tags, meta descriptions, structured data, site architecture, blog content
10. **Customer Retention** — Loyalty program, subscription offering, post-purchase experience
11. **App Stack** — Review installed apps for redundancy, performance impact, cost
12. **Recommendations** — Prioritized by expected revenue impact and implementation effort

## Shopify-Specific Tracking Setup

### Meta Pixel + CAPI
- Use Shopify's Customer Events (Pixel API) — not the old theme-based pixel
- Enable CAPI through Facebook & Instagram channel app
- Verify Event Match Quality score in Meta Events Manager (target 8+)
- Track: PageView, ViewContent, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout, Purchase

### Google Ads + Enhanced Conversions
- Install Google & YouTube channel for Shopping + Performance Max
- Set up Enhanced Conversions in Google Ads
- Verify conversion tracking in Google Tag Assistant
- Feed optimization: product titles, descriptions, GTINs, custom labels

### GA4
- Recommended: Google Tag Manager via Shopify Pixel API (Custom Pixel)
- Alternative: Google & YouTube channel (simpler but less control)
- Key events: page_view, view_item, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, purchase
- Enhanced measurement: site search, scroll depth, outbound clicks

## How to Use This Skill

Ask me questions like:
- "Audit my Shopify store's conversion funnel"
- "What apps should I add to my Shopify marketing stack?"
- "Help me set up Meta CAPI on Shopify"
- "My add-to-cart rate is low — what should I optimize?"
- "Design a post-purchase upsell strategy"
- "How do I optimize my Google Shopping product feed?"
- "Review my Shopify checkout for conversion improvements"
- "Plan a loyalty program for my DTC brand"

For detailed Shopify API reference, Liquid theme customization, and advanced configurations, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Analysis Examples

For complete analysis patterns, sample outputs, and use cases, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## Scripts

The skill includes utility scripts for API interaction and automated analysis:

### Fetch Store Data
```bash
# Get store info (API health check)
python scripts/shopify_client.py --resource shop

# List recent orders
python scripts/shopify_client.py --resource orders --days 30

# Export products as CSV
python scripts/shopify_client.py --resource products --status active --format csv --output products.csv

# Quick order count
python scripts/shopify_client.py --resource order-count --status any
```

### Run Analysis
```bash
# Full store audit (all analyses combined)
python scripts/analyze.py --analysis-type full-audit

# Conversion funnel (last 30 days)
python scripts/analyze.py --analysis-type conversion-funnel --days 30

# Product performance
python scripts/analyze.py --analysis-type product-performance --days 30

# Customer cohorts (last 90 days)
python scripts/analyze.py --analysis-type customer-cohorts --days 90

# Revenue analysis with output file
python scripts/analyze.py --analysis-type revenue-analysis --days 30 --output revenue.json
```

The scripts handle API authentication, rate limiting, pagination, and basic analysis. I'll interpret the results and provide actionable recommendations.

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication Error**: Verify that:
- `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL` is your `.myshopify.com` URL (not your custom domain)
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` starts with `shpat_` and is from a Custom App
- The app has the required API scopes (read_orders, read_products, read_customers)

**Rate Limiting**: The scripts handle Shopify's 2 requests/second limit automatically. If you see 429 errors, the retry logic will wait and continue. For large stores, consider using `--limit` to reduce data volume.

**No Orders Returned**: Check that:
- The date range (`--days`) covers a period with orders
- The `--status` filter matches your orders (use `any` to see all)
- The Admin API access token hasn't expired

**Import Errors**: Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Security & Privacy

- **Never hardcode** API credentials in code — use `.env` files
- Store access tokens **outside** version control
- Add `.env` and credential files to `.gitignore`
- The scripts are **read-only** — they do not create, modify, or delete any Shopify data
- Use Admin API scopes with minimum required access (read-only)
- Customer PII (emails, names) is processed locally and never stored persistently
- Rotate access tokens periodically
