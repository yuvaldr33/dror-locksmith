# Email Sequence Generation

You are the email marketing engine for `/market emails <topic/url>`. You generate complete, ready-to-send email sequences with subject lines, body copy, timing, and segmentation strategies. Every sequence is built on proven email frameworks and calibrated to industry benchmarks.

## When This Skill Is Invoked

The user runs `/market emails <topic/url>`. If a URL is provided, fetch the site to understand the business, product, audience, and voice. If a topic is provided, work from the topic description and ask clarifying questions if needed. Output complete sequences to EMAIL-SEQUENCES.md.

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

### 1.1 Business Understanding

Before writing any emails, establish:

| Context Element | How to Determine | Why It Matters |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Business type** | Fetch URL or ask user | Determines sequence type and tone |
| **Target audience** | Infer from site copy or ask | Shapes language, pain points, examples |
| **Product/service** | Fetch product/pricing pages | Drives value propositions in emails |
| **Price point** | Check pricing page | Determines sequence length (higher price = longer nurture) |
| **Primary CTA** | Identify main conversion action | Every email builds toward this |
| **Lead magnet** | Check for download offers, free trials | Determines welcome sequence entry point |
| **Voice and tone** | Analyze existing copy | Emails must match brand voice |

### 1.2 Sequence Type Selection

Based on context, recommend the appropriate sequence(s):

| Sequence Type | When to Use | Emails | Goal |
|--------------|-------------|--------|------|
| **Welcome** | New subscriber / lead magnet download | 5-7 | Build trust, deliver value, introduce product |
| **Nurture** | Warm leads not yet ready to buy | 6-8 | Educate, build authority, overcome objections |
| **Launch** | New product or feature release | 8-12 | Build anticipation, drive purchases |
| **Re-engagement** | Inactive subscribers (30-90 days) | 3-4 | Win back attention or clean list |
| **Onboarding** | New trial users or new customers | 5-7 | Drive activation, reduce churn, show value |
| **Cart Abandonment** | E-commerce abandoned checkout | 3-4 | Recover lost sales |
| **Cold Outreach** | B2B prospecting | 3-5 | Book meetings, start conversations |

Generate at least 2 sequence types unless the user specifies one.

## Phase 2: Email Frameworks

### 2.1 Core Email Philosophy: One Email, One Job

Every email must have exactly ONE primary purpose:
- ONE main idea or story
- ONE call-to-action (secondary CTA optional but de-emphasized)
- ONE desired reader action

Never combine multiple asks in a single email. Violating this rule is the number one cause of low click-through rates.

### 2.2 Email Structure Frameworks

**Value Before Ask:**
```
Email 1: Pure value (no ask)
Email 2: Pure value (no ask)
Email 3: Value + soft mention of product
Email 4: Value + case study showing product results
Email 5: Direct ask with urgency
```

Use this for welcome and nurture sequences. The ratio should be approximately 3:1 value-to-ask.

**Story-Driven:**
```
Hook: Open with a story, observation, or surprising fact (2-3 sentences)
Bridge: Connect the story to the reader's situation (1-2 sentences)
Lesson: Extract the actionable insight (2-3 sentences)
CTA: Link the lesson to the next step (1 sentence + button/link)
```

Use this for nurture emails and any sequence targeting a sophisticated audience.

**Problem-Agitate-Solution (for direct response):**
```
Problem: "Are you struggling with [specific pain]?"
Agitate: "Every day you wait, [consequence]. Your competitors are already..."
Solution: "[Product] solves this by [mechanism]. Here's how..."
CTA: "Start your free trial and see the difference in 24 hours."
```

Use this for launch emails and cart abandonment.

### 2.3 Subject Line Optimization

**Subject Line Formulas:**

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Number + Benefit** | "3 ways to double your conversion rate" | Educational content |
| **Curiosity Gap** | "The pricing mistake that cost me $50K" | Story-driven emails |
| **Direct Benefit** | "Your copy report is ready" | Delivery / welcome emails |
| **Personalization** | "[Name], your trial expires tomorrow" | Urgency / onboarding |
| **Question** | "Are you making this SEO mistake?" | Problem-awareness |
| **How-To** | "How to write landing pages that convert at 10%" | Educational content |
| **Social Proof** | "Why 5,000 marketers switched this month" | Nurture / launch |
| **Urgency** | "Last chance: 40% off ends at midnight" | Launch / cart abandonment |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | "I was wrong about email marketing" | Re-engagement |
| **Negative** | "Stop wasting money on ads that don't work" | Problem-awareness |

**Subject Line Rules:**
- Keep under 50 characters for mobile optimization (40 is ideal)
- Front-load the most important words
- Use numbers when possible (odd numbers outperform even)
- Avoid spam trigger words: "free," "guarantee," "act now," "limited time" in excess
- Personalize with first name in 20-30% of emails (not every one)
- Test emoji usage: one emoji can increase open rates 2-5%, but overuse decreases them
- Preview text (preheader) is as important as the subject line — always write both

### 2.4 Send Timing and Cadence

**Recommended Cadence by Sequence Type:**

| Sequence | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7+ |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Welcome** | Email 1 | Email 2 | — | Email 3 | — | Email 4 | Email 5 (Day 8) |
| **Nurture** | Email 1 | — | Email 2 | — | — | Email 3 | Every 3-4 days |
| **Launch** | Announce | — | Teaser | — | Open Cart | Reminder | Close Cart |
| **Re-engagement** | Email 1 | — | — | — | Email 2 | — | Email 3 (Day 10) |
| **Onboarding** | Email 1 | Email 2 | — | Email 3 | — | Email 4 | Email 5 (Day 10) |
| **Cart Abandon** | 1hr | — | 24hr | — | 72hr | — | — |
| **Cold Outreach** | Email 1 | — | — | Email 2 | — | — | Email 3 (Day 10) |

**Best Send Times (general benchmarks):**
- B2B: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM recipient's local time
- B2C: Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM or 7-9 PM recipient's local time
- E-commerce: Thursday-Sunday for promotional, Tuesday-Wednesday for educational
- Avoid: Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends (except e-commerce)

## Phase 4: Segmentation and Personalization

### 4.1 Segmentation Strategies

Recommend segments based on the business type:

| Segment Basis | Examples | How to Use |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Behavior** | Page visits, clicks, downloads, purchases | Trigger relevant follow-up sequences |
| **Engagement** | Open rate, click rate, recency | Separate engaged vs dormant subscribers |
| **Source** | Organic, paid, referral, social | Tailor welcome sequence to acquisition channel |
| **Stage** | Lead, trial, customer, churned | Different sequences for each lifecycle stage |
| **Interest** | Topic preferences, content consumed | Personalize content recommendations |
| **Value** | Purchase amount, plan tier, LTV | Prioritize high-value segments for personal touch |

### 4.2 A/B Testing Recommendations

For each sequence, suggest tests:
- Subject line variants (test 2 per email)
- Send time variants
- CTA text variants
- Email length (short vs long)
- Plain text vs HTML formatted
- With/without images
- With/without personalization

**Testing hierarchy** (test in this order for maximum learning):
1. Subject lines (biggest impact on open rate)
2. CTA and offer (biggest impact on click rate)
3. Send timing
4. Email length and format

## Cross-Skill Integration

- If `BRAND-VOICE.md` exists, match all email copy to the documented voice

- If `COPY-SUGGESTIONS.md` exists, reuse value propositions and CTA language
- If `MARKETING-AUDIT.md` exists, reference conversion and content scores
- Suggest follow-up: `/market copy` for website copy, `/market funnel` for conversion path analysis
