## Phase 5: Ad Variations and Testing

### 5.1 Variation Generation

- 3 visual concept descriptions (for designer handoff)

### 5.2 Testing Framework

**Test Priority Order:**
1. Audience (who you target matters most)
2. Offer (what you offer: free trial vs demo vs discount)
3. Creative concept (the big idea and visual approach)
4. Headline (specific wording of the hook)
5. Body copy (supporting text)
6. CTA (button text and color)

**Testing Rules:**
- Test one variable at a time
- Run tests for at least 3-5 days or 1,000 impressions per variant
- Statistical significance threshold: 95%
- Kill underperformers at 2x the CPA target
- Scale winners by 20% budget increments (not 2x overnight)
