## Important Rules
- Always check pricing pages, about pages, and blog to assess strategy
- Be specific with revenue estimates — even rough ranges are helpful
- Frame everything through a revenue lens, not just "best practices"
- Identify the single biggest growth lever — what one change would have the most impact?
- Consider the business type when making recommendations (SaaS vs E-commerce vs Agency, etc.)
